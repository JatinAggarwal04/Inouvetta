## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Invoice Ingestion via Email  
- UiPath RPA bot monitors an email inbox for new invoices.  
- If an email has **no attachment**, the sender is notified automatically.  
- If an email has **no subject**, it is ignored.  
- Valid invoices are **saved to Google Drive** for further processing.  

### 2️⃣ Data Extraction & Storage  
- OCR extracts invoice details (invoice number, vendor, amount, taxes, etc.).  
- Extracted data is **stored in a Supabase database** under the `invoices` table.  
- Each invoice is assigned a unique `invoice_id`.  

### 3️⃣ Automated Invoice Flagging  
- Invoices are **automatically flagged** based on predefined rules:  
  - Missing details  
  - Tax discrepancies  
  - Duplicate detection  
- Flagged invoices are inserted into the `flagged` table for review.  

### 4️⃣ Email Notification System  
- A Python script **checks for flagged invoices** in Supabase.  
- If a new invoice is flagged:  
  - It retrieves the appropriate **reviewer's email** based on `level`.  
  - Sends an **email notification** with invoice details.  

📧 **Example Email Notification**:  
Subject: New Flagged Invoice: INV-12345
